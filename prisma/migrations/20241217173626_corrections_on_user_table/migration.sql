  Warnings:

  - You are about to alter the column `username` on the `User` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `Text` to `VarChar(255)`.
  - You are about to alter the column `email` on the `User` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `Text` to `VarChar(255)`.
  - Added the required column `loginToken` to the `User` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Made the column `password` on table `User` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
